## Project Overview
Resume Generator is a full‑stack web application built to help users generate professional resumes using AI assistance. The user inputs key information (skills, experience, education, etc.), and the AI assists in crafting strong sentences and formatting. Users can export or download the final resume as a PDF or shareable link.

---

## Features
- User input form for personal details, education, work experience, skills, and achievements.
- AI‑assisted content generation (bullet points, summaries, keyword optimization).
- Multiple resume templates for preview and download (PDF/Docx).
- Responsive UI for all devices.
- Authentication (optional/expandable) for saving profiles.
- Easily deployable full‑stack app.
